          architect Richard Kroeker

          From a Mi’kmaq perspective, language is fundamental to an
          understanding of place and plays an active role in how things in that
          place evolve over time. Understanding and expressing Mi’kmaq concepts
          requires an intimate knowledge of the language, and attempts to
          express them in English will always be approximate, with all the
          potential for inaccuracy and lack of nuance that creates. Mi’kmaq
          words express things in a dynamic and relational sense; verbs
          predominate over nouns. Things are not understood as discrete, bounded
          objects, but expressed in all their active, relational capacity. Built
          into the language and all ways of knowing is the sense that you avoid
          giving offense to nature. This is a core notion, guiding principle and
          overarching way of being.
        </p>
        <p class="philp">
          In the Mi’kmaq world, there is no sense of otherness with regard to
          nature. The Mi’kmaq words “M’st no’Kmaq”(all my relations) is a direct
          expression of this. Our relations extend to all creatures and all
          aspects of nature. Language is employed within the context of
          collective consciousness. Through the focusing of the mind and framing
          of concepts, language transmits ideas and actively searches for
          connections across time and space. Built works begin with words, and
          so language plays a strong role in the formulation of all things.
        </p>
        <p class="philp">
          The response of a building to its cultural context extends beyond
          graphic visual references. Form and the generative principles from
          which it arises are fundamental to architecture. In Mi’kmaq terms,
          form is related to purpose. It’s legibility and authenticity resides
          in its function. When efficiency is compromised, it is inevitably at a
          cost. This is the principle of doing more with less; conservation of
          material and energy is the objective. Meaningful forms emerge from
          natural processes. MI’kmaq ways of making and knowing have emerged
          over a long time in a unique environment. The Mi’kmaq word “netulimk”
          (provisioning) summarizes this principle: we are supported in all our
          needs by nature, without compromising our surroundings. The
          consideration of impacts over time extends to seven generations.
          Natural forms are analyzed and understood in those terms: as being
          generated by the principle of their suitability to purpose within
          their environment, shaped by their many relationships over time.
        </p>
        <p class="philp">
          Historically, buildings in a Mi’kmaq cultural context needed to be
          efficiently assembled and disassembled by a system of articulated
          components and connections to respond to changing seasons, locations,
          and varying social situations. Some parts would be more permanent,
          remain in location while other parts were transported and regularly
          replaced. Form-giving forces aren’t external to the place and
          situation: they follow the internal logic of the locale, material,
          social dynamic, and anticipated impacts over time. Forms can give
          expression to the cultural significance of a building in terms of the
          level of articulation and craft employed in their making. The critical
          framework for assessing a building are rooted in how it performs, in
          its practicality within the context of its social purpose, and its
          long-term consequences for the rest of the natural environment.
        </p>
        <p class="philp">
          Like all aspects of creation in the Mi’kmaq context, materials have an
          inherent animacy: a spiritual as well as a physical aspect. They
          contain embodied information and energy which can direct their
          transformation. As reflected in the language: things are regarded as
          being active, and defined by their active relationships. We exist in
          relationship to all other things and that relationship extends beyond
          an external sensory awareness to a spiritual connection. It is these
          relationships that give definition to things, not their presumed
          boundaries as objects.
        </p>
        <p class="philp">
          The collection of material for fabrication is accompanied by a
          ceremony, as with the gathering of food or medicine. The ceremony is
          one of asking permission, an explanation of purpose, and an act of
          thanksgiving. In relationships, all partners have a reciprocal agency,
          and so it is understood that those materials, as they are transformed,
          in turn have a role in shaping us: how we feel, think and experience
          the world around us. This deep connection with the environment is
          maintained through close observation, through ceremony, through
          intuition, and through dreams.
        </p>
        <p class="philp">
          An important aspect of Mi’kmaq thinking relevant to understanding form
          generation, is with regard to symbols, their use and meaning. While
          architects might concentrate on abstract symbols as easy points of
          identification or reference, from a Mi’kmaq perspective, symbols have
          meaning by virtue of the consequent actions they bring about. They
          exert a force that goes beyond being abstract points of association or
          memory devices. In Mi’kmaq thinking, symbols are understood as active,
          dynamic forces. The primary intent of symbols is to register and
          nurture connections within human society and with all of nature.
          Dakota elder Chris Leith, with whom we have both worked in Dakota
          territory, once pointed out that the true symbolic meaning of a flag,
          conventionally thought of as a signifier of nationality, territory,
          and patriotic allegiance, was in its potential for use as a blanket to
          nurture someone, to be wrapped around them for warmth and comfort.
          This example from Dakota culture also illustrates Mi’kmaq thinking
          about symbols.
        </p>
        <p class="philp">
          The making of space is related to the making of form and the
          understanding of natural form. Once created, spaces have their own
          active energy. There is no empty space. When you enter a space, you
          enter into its energy. An important aspect of space creation is the
          avoidance of any hierarchies with regard to occupants. The absence of
          hierarchy is based in a profound sense of mutual respect. All
          participants in a space are aspects of the same whole to be treated
          with an equal respect rooted in compassion. Within Mi’kmaq
          consciousness, we are understood to derive our strength from the
          deepening of our connections with our natural context, including the
          human community, not through a perceived independence created by the
          isolation of constructed boundaries. All our powers as humans derive
          from the nurturing of relationships. The purpose of form and space
          making is not to fortify us against the rest of nature and society,
          but to enable and deepen the connection. Fostering a spirit of
          community is the overarching dynamic of space.
        </p>
        <p class="philp">
          Consideration of the scale of a space is a matter of empowerment. One
          must consider how the scale of the space might avoid the alienation of
          the users of the space, through separation and isolation. All space
          making has an ethical dimension in that it must foster respect without
          reference to hierarchies. A space is a place of coming together of
          disparate cultures and viewpoints. The primary purpose of space
          becomes inclusion, not exclusion or separation. While spaces will vary
          to suit them to their purpose, they are not arranged for the purpose
          of ranking into lesser or greater spaces, or of “served and servant”
          spaces, as some architects sometimes refer to them. Light, colour,
          textures, acoustics, legibility, and relationships to other spaces
          give a space its active capacity. Spaces should accommodate many
          different occasions and be capable of adapting to the cycles of time.
        </p>
        <p class="philp">
          The circle is the space of meeting and social interaction. Each member
          of a circle is an equal participant. The speaker or performer remains
          within the circle, and having begun to speak, is given the full time
          they require, without interruption. The option to speak passes around
          the circle to the next person, in a clockwise direction, until each
          viewpoint has been fully presented. In this way, many viewpoints are
          brought to the subject under discussion, and these can be expressed in
          a non-hierarchical setting based on mutual respect. This circular
          space of meeting, and the accompanying underlying ethos apply no
          matter what the outer shape of the enclosure in which it takes place.
        </p>
        <p class="philp">
          Curved, circular forms are also made for their inherent structural
          stability, and for their efficiency in enclosing more useable area
          with less material than other plan geometries. Curved forms
          efficiently deflect the forces of wind and precipitation from all
          directions, distributing directional loads throughout the structure.
        </p>
        <p class="philp">
          Spaces give the occupants a sense of presence and location. Spaces
          respond to direction, with each direction bringing its own forces to
          bear on the arrangement of spaces and the resulting form. The path of
          the sun, the winds, and views orient us within a space, and connect us
          to the other forces of nature.
        </p>
        <p class="philp">
          This connection to the land and place is established and renewed
          through ceremonies, often involving music. Those with the ability to
          understand and gather medicines from the land often speak of the
          plants singing to them. The Mi’kmaq word for medicine,
          (“Medideskewey”) is the word which can be literally translated as
          “something which makes a sound”. If you are attuned to the land, the
          medicine you are seeking will address you. All medicine acts in this
          way. Just as we ask permission when collecting building materials,
          food, or medicines, permission is asked and thanks are offered for use
          of the land. An expression of deep appreciation engages the singing
          voice; singing connects to the spirit intrinsic to all things. Certain
          people are designated as keepers of the songs pertaining to particular
          places, occasions and events in a discernment process.
        </p>
        <p class="philp">
          Mi’kmaqi consists of seven territories of distinct ecological zones.
          Leaving the territory in which one lives and entering another
          territory is done with consideration and with ceremony. The word “Kwe”
          is shouted to announce a crossing into new territory. There was
          traditionally a song corresponding to each particular territory.
          People are welcomed into new territory by being taught the song of
          that territory. This is another aspect of the concept of consonance
          with the land.
        </p>
        <p class="philp">
          As with social relationships, relationships within all creation are
          viewed as non-hierarchical. Humans are not superior beings with
          respect to each other or to other beings in the natural world. Within
          the language, there is no sense of ownership or dominance over any
          aspect of nature. In a language where verbs predominate, there are
          many verb tenses enabling a subtle understanding and expression of the
          complex relationships within nature.
        </p>
        <p class="philp">
          The things we make or build are considered a transformed aspect of
          nature. Built artefacts are not exclusively owned as the property of
          the maker, but remain as a part of nature at large, taking on their
          own power to be agents in enacting transformative relationships.
          Language provides the guiding energy for the initiation of ideas and
          for their emergence into forms.
        </p>
        <p class="philp">
          Language provides the means for shaping and sharing knowledge.
          Knowledge is itself alive and dynamic. Transmitting knowledge has an
          aspect of gardening: when it is tended, it grows. Knowledge will seek
          and find the place where it is directed or attracted. Initiating the
          flow of knowledge begins with the framing of a question. The form of
          the question presents the vessel into which knowledge will flow.
          Changing the way in which a question is formulated opens new
          possibilities of learning.
        </p>
        <p class="philp">
          There is no reference point that is outside nature, and so there is no
          sense of the otherness of nature. Language and knowledge are animate
          aspects of nature, and not a platform, frame or abstract scaffolding
          positioned outside nature. This all-encompassing nature is in its
          essence compassionate and nurturing. When there is disharmony,
          illness, or need, nature is the source of all remedies, summed up in
          the Mi’kmaq word “netulimk” . The Mi’kmaq language is oriented toward
          thankfulness and reverence to nature at all times in all things.
        </p>
        <p class="philp">
          The power of language is in its ability to produce transformation. It
          gives rise to new forms and new dynamics. It has a direct power to
          heal, and is used with a consciousness of its power. If an idea comes
          about as result of an individual dream, vision, or insight, it is
          activated through language and must enter collective consciousness
          before coming to realization. It is understood as having emerged from
          a collective world of active knowledge, so there isn’t a sense of the
          “originality” or personal ownership of a vision or of ideas. No one
          owns an idea or has exclusive rights to it. It has emerged from the
          living body of knowledge that is a part of nature. It takes on its
          transformative power by being shared.
        </p>
        <p class="philp">
          New ideas are assessed in terms of their effects or potential effects
          on human society and the rest of nature; the seven-generation time
          frame applies. The principle of maintaining harmony and attunement
          applies. For information to be alive and have currency, it must remain
          in circulation. It can’t be bottled up in a book or kept private
          amongst a few initiates. To encapsulate information in this way will
          cause it to stagnate, like a stagnant pool relative to a flowing
          river. Just as all things are alive, they also have the potential to
          communicate and partake in the flow of information. All are present in
          a vast network and flow of relationships.
        </p>
        <p class="philp">
          The colonization experience, with the catastrophic effect on the
          population, its relentless suppression of all aspects of Mi’kmaq
          culture, and its polarization of world views, created a schism in
          architectural continuity. Patterns of living, access to land and
          resources, and the relationships with the environment changed rapidly
          and profoundly. The architecture of the colonists was based on
          European precedents. They aspired to match stylistic precedents from
          Europe, whose architecture was primarily one of stereotomic elements,
          the shaping and stacking of relatively massive components. Our
          academic histories traditionally often have focussed on attempts at
          architectural permanence. Anything that didn’t aspire to permanence
          was relegated to the fringes of academic architectural histories. In
          this tradition, architectural and artistic expressions are often
          understood as expressions of our individuality, and our spaces and
          cities are understood as defenses against nature based on the illusory
          notion that we can achieve independence from the very forces that
          formed us and nurture us.
        </p>
        <p class="philp">
          Indigenous Mi’kmaq architecture, by contrast, was conscious of its
          position within the natural cycles.
        </p>
        <p class="philp">
          Mi’kmaq building strategies are essentially tectonic. Building
          involved a system of often light-weight components and connections
          that allowed for a response to changing seasons and adapted to
          differing occasions in ways that created seamless continuity with the
          natural context. It consisted of articulated components and layers
          that allowed for mobility as well as adaptation to the seasons. Over
          time, the colonists found that their largely stereotomic architecture
          could not respond well to the North Eastern North American climate and
          material context, often owing more to stylistic preoccupations and an
          aesthetic agenda than to functionalism. Within this region, current
          main stream building practices, particularly in housing, have adopted
          the more Indigenous approach of using light wooden frames strengthened
          and insulated by the addition of layers, in a composite strategy that
          responds to available resource, climate, and can accommodate a variety
          of social and cultural uses.
        </p>
        <p class="philp">
          Like dwellings, canoes were built with an overall understanding of
          material, connection and information flow. They were lightweight,
          durable, and efficient. Information required to shape canoes, as well
          as other structures, did not traditionally require drawings, but is
          inherent in the construction process itself, where one step becomes
          the template for the next. As with dwellings, the overall form of the
          canoe, and its detailed connections respond to the context in which
          canoe will be used: whether ocean waves, fast streams, windy open lake
          conditions, or small streams overhung with trees. Regional formal
          variations are often classified as expressions of culture, but to
          understand them completely, they need to be analyzed in the context of
          their response to their material environments, and the functional
          requirements related to the dynamic context and uses to which they are
          put within that context.
        </p>
        <p class="philp">
          In any construction project, defined roles were traditionally given to
          women and to men, for the purpose of ensuring that both male and
          female energies have a presence in the project, during the work
          process and in its realization. These are general strategies which
          involved an understanding of material properties, special connections,
          and an understanding of both embodied energy and continuing energy
          needs. The use of thermal mass, attention to air quality, seasonal
          adaptability, social adaptability, material properties, and life cycle
          environmental impacts were well understood as the drivers of decisions
          regarding the form.

          In the context of the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of
          Indigenous People (<a
            href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/declaration-on-the-rights-of-indigenous-peoples.html"
            >https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/declaration-on-the-rights-of-indigenous-peoples.html</a
          >), officially endorsed by the Canadian Government in May of 2016,
          represents an appropriate advance in the continuing process of
          decolonization. Architecture is a major expression of how a society
          sees itself in relation to surrounding nature and to other societies.
          There must be an acknowledgement of this in the processes by which
          buildings are designed, procured and implemented within Indigenous
          territories.
        </p>
        <p class="philp">
          The dominant contemporary reading of architecture as a cultural
          practice takes place within an assumed technological context, often
          regarded as separate from the natural realm. Indigenous approaches can
          teach us that responding to defined functional and environmental
          issues can lead to designs that are appropriate, and authentic
          cultural expressions. Buildings derive their identity and authenticity
          from the direct, articulated dynamics which shaped them, and an
          understanding of how they act upon us and the environments in which
          they exist.

          “European based” Science aspires to objectivity, tending to abstract
          and obscure the human element into issues of economics or politics.
          Use of the concept of objectivity easily becomes a means to privilege
          the interests of power elites. Architecture is directly engaged with
          political and economic processes, often put forward as objective
          issues. Two Eyed Seeing offers another awareness that puts these
          charged issues into a more appropriate framework. clarifying to whose
          benefits the purportedly “objective” issues directing procurement
          processes, are directed Architecture is always a collective endeavour.
          In producing architecture, there needs to be an honest assessment of
          where the economic benefits reside in the procurement processes, and
          funding structures. Architects are the technicians who are charged
          with realizing a collective vision. Included is an advocacy for human
