            <p class="biotext"> <span class="bioname">Elder Dr. Albert Marshall, LLD</span> is from the Moose Clan of the Mi’kmaq Nation. He was married to the late Murdena Marshall and together they lived in Eskasoni First Nation in Unama'ki-Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. Albert and Murdena have long been passionate advocates for the preservation, promotion, and revitalization of Mi'kmaw Traditional Knowledge, including
                language, spirituality, stories, practices, and ways of knowing. In 2009, Albert and Murdena
                were awarded Honorary Doctorates in recognition of their devotion and commitment to
                this work. Their energy, wisdom, and knowledge helped create the innovative Integrative Science academic program at Cape Breton University in the 1990s. Together, Albert and
                Murdena have developed KECCA (Knowledge Education & Culture Consultant Associates) to better enable their work and to encourage a strong future for the Mi’kmaw Nation and its peoples. Albert is a passionate advocate of cross- cultural understandings and healing and of our human responsibilities to care for all creatures and our Earth Mother. He a fluent speaker of Mi'kmaw and the “designated voice” for the Mi’kmaw Elders of Unama’ki with respect to environmental issues. Albert sits on various committees and boards that guide initiatives in natural resource management, Aboriginal health research and education, or that serve First Nations’ governance issues or that otherwise work towards ethical environmental, social and economic practices. For example, he is a member of the Advisory Council for Unama’ki College of Cape Breton University, the Steering Committee for the Collaborative Environmental
                Planning Initiative (CEPI) for the Bras d’Or Lake, and the Advisory Board for the National Collaborating Centre for Aboriginal Health headquartered at the University of Northern British Columbia. Albert also served for several years on the board for the Bras d’Or Lake Biosphere Reserve Association, the group that successfully obtained UNESCO designation for the biosphere. He is the person who coined the phrase Two-Eyed Seeing / Etuaptmumk as a guiding principle for collaborative work which encourages learning to see from one eye with the strengths of Indigenous knowledges and ways of knowing, and from the other eye with the strengths of Western knowledges and ways of knowing ... and learning to use both these eyes together, for the benefit of all. In 2009, Albert was awarded the Marshall Award for Aboriginal Leadership as part of the Eco-Hero Awards delivered by the NS Environmental Network (an umbrella organization of provincial environmental and health organizations). 
                Albert was born in Eskasoni, NS. As a young boy, he was taken away from his family and spent many years as an inmate of the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School on the mainland of Nova Scotia. Albert was profoundly affected by this experience but today seldom talks about those many painful and traumatic years. Rather, the experience has led him on a lifelong quest to connect with and understand both the culture he was removed from, and the culture he was
                forced into ... and to help these cultures find ways to live in mutual respect of each
                other's strengths and ways. In 2018 Albert Marshall was conferred the Degree Doctor of Humanities by Acadia University for his advocacy from a Mi’kmaq perspective on environmental issues affecting lands, forests and fisheries.

        technology in conjunction with environmental concerns have been used to inform and
        guide his designs and the resulting built form.
        Kevin has worked at the highest levels of design in disciplines of architecture,
        engineering and construction management for over 20 years. Prior to establishing
        701 Architecture he worked as a construction / project manager for the Pictou

      <p class="biotext"><span class="bioname">Destiny Seymour</span> is an Anishinaabe interior designer based in Winnipeg, Manitoba.
        Destiny graduated with a Master of Interior Design from the University of Manitoba.
        She worked at Prairie Architects Inc. for over 10 years as lead interior designer before
        starting her own design business, Indigo Arrows in 2016. After struggling to find materials that she could incorporate into interior design projects, Destiny began designing
        artisan textiles which respectfully reflect local Manitoban Indigenous communities and
        their history. Indigo Arrows now offers a range of table linens, pillows, and blankets
        that showcase patterns from local Indigenous pottery and bone tools that date from
        400 to over 3000 years old. For thousands of years, Indigenous people in Manitoba
        have created beautiful patterns to adorn their pottery and bone tools. Most of these
        surviving pieces are held in private collections and museums. Using a variety of ma-
        terials & mediums, Destiny hopes to revive these ancient patterns to provoke thought, bridge gaps, inspire and empower.
        Destiny formed Woven Collaborative, an Indigenous led design studio, with fellow
        designer Mamie Griffith. Their design practice takes a critical look at the represen-
        tation of Indigenous cultures within the built environment. Their design mission is
        to respectfully reflect local Indigenous cultures & identity within architectural forms,
        interior spaces, furniture, and textiles. Their design process acknowledges community
        engagement, inclusiveness, and collaboration when creating new works.
        Relevant projects include: Clan Mother’s Healing Village Lake Winnipeg, Indigenous
        Digital Media Lab University of Winnipeg, Aboriginal Peoples’ Television Network
        Headquarters, Makoonsag Intergenerational Learning Centre and Daycare, Migiizi
        Agamik Aboriginal Student Centre University of Manitoba.</p>      </div>
