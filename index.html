          Mawlukutimk is a collaborative formed to design in the context of
          Mi’kmaq culture. Collectively and individually, members of the group
          have been involved in sustained, in-depth explorations of ways of
          knowing and doing. This has, at times, involved studying and
          documenting the work and knowledge of elders, with consideration of
          how that knowledge currently applies. The notion of Etuaptmumk or
          Two-Eyed Seeing, as developed and articulated by Elder Dr. Albert
          Marshall, has deeply informed how we understand tradition and how we
          approach the application of the principles and understandings from
          within the tradition to how we design for the future. Etuaptmumk /
          Two-Eyed Seeing applies to understandings of building science
          expressed in the knowledge of material, structures, and environmental
          relationships that are demonstrated and embedded in traditional
          Mi’kmaq practices. The principles learned have then been studied in
          terms of how they can be adapted to the requirements of contemporary
          practice, together with a consideration of their seven-generation
          effects. Each of the members of Mawlukutimk have studied Indigenous
          ways of knowing, making and building in consideration of their
          contemporary and future relevance, as well as their historic
          importance.The purpose of this body of work has always been to foster
          cultural renewal and continuity, not only in terms of expressions of
          culture, but an understanding of the principles underlying those
          cultural expressions. In doing their work, members of the group have a
          long history of consultation with Mi’kmaq of all communities and
          generations, particularly the elders, for whom we give thanks,
          Wela’lin.
